Portworx provides the capability to encrypt volumes using cluster-wide secrets. A cluster-wide secret is a unique secret
for a cluster that can be used as a default key for encrypting your volumes. However, this poses a problem while migrating 
such volumes across clusters. The destination cluster needs to have the same cluster-wide secret in order to use the
migrated encrypted volume.

The following set of commands will help you dump the cluster-wide secret from one cluster and upload the same secret to
a different cluster. Once the cluster-wide secret is uploaded to the destination cluster, encrypted volumes using the cluster-wide
secret can be migrated to the destination cluster.


### Dumping cluster-wide secret

Run the following command to dump the cluster-wide secret:

```text
pxctl secrets  dump-cluster-wide-secret
```

```output
Following are the details about the cluster-wide secret for this cluster:

Secret ID (--secret_id): demo_secret_id
Secret value (--secret_value): AQIDAHiFBNOMzjedxcurzMsjimuzjkzzx99/lUtayeBPH38SNAF5duc4foWsMAGBmsjOvLPtAAAAfjB8BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagbzBtAgEAMGgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZ9WsX37ZmWVPIjsEAgEQgDs+UIl5k3AK4JxpX4uiw1qQbGwBuGALKIL7rYN8k5daq0q3xnz+EXs8PFltmkNbZGcGfkKelIS2Z5dYhA==

Run the following command on the destination cluster:

 /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets upload-cluster-wide-secret --secret_id demo_secret_id --secret_value AQIDAHiFBNOMzjedxcurzMsjimuzjkzzx99/lUtayeBPH38SNAF5duc4foWsMAGBmsjOvLPtAAAAfjB8BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagbzBtAgEAMGgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZ9WsX37ZmWVPIjsEAgEQgDs+UIl5k3AK4JxpX4uiw1qQbGwBuGALKIL7rYN8k5daq0q3xnz+EXs8PFltmkNbZGcGfkKelIS2Z5dYhA==

```

The `dump` command also spits out the corresponding upload command that needs to be executed on the destination cluster.

### Upload cluster-wide secret

The `dump-cluster-wide-secret` command outputs an `upload-cluster-wide-secret` command. Use this command on the destination cluster to upload the cluster-wide secret:

```text
pxctl secrets upload-cluster-wide-secret --secret_id demo_secret_id --secret_value AQIDAHiFBNOMzjedxcurzMsjimuzjkzzx99/lUtayeBPH38SNAF5duc4foWsMAGBmsjOvLPtAAAAfjB8BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagbzBtAgEAMGgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMZ9WsX37ZmWVPIjsEAgEQgDs+UIl5k3AK4JxpX4uiw1qQbGwBuGALKIL7rYN8k5daq0q3xnz+EXs8PFltmkNbZGcGfkKelIS2Z5dYhA==
```

```output
Successfully uploaded cluster-wide secret.
```
