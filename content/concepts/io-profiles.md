You can optimize the performance of your Portworx volumes by matching the type of workload you're running with a suitable IO profile. IO profiles change the how a Portworx volume interacts with the underlying storage disks to improve traffic for different workloads.

## Understand the different IO profiles

Portworx currently features the following IO profiles:

* auto
* db
* db_remote
* sequential
* random


### The auto profile
If you don't provide an IO profile, Portworx will default to `auto`. This profile automatically applies an IO profile that based on congifuration details it sees, and switches between `none` and `db_remote`. Portworx chooses `db_remote` when a volume's replication factor is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it defaults to `none`.

### The db profile
Databases typically result in a large number of flush operations on the disk. Because a flush forces Portworx to wait until the data is synched on the disk, it can slow down traffic. When the `db` profile is active, Portworx batches flush operations for a quicker write response time.

**NOTE:** 

* If there are not enough nodes online, Portworx will automatically disable this algorithm.
* The `db` profile only applies if you have a repl count of 2 or more.

### The db_remote profile

This implements a write-back flush coalescing algorithm. This algorithm attempts to coalesce multiple `syncs` that occur within a 50ms window into a single sync. Coalesced syncs are acknowledged only after copying to all replicas. In order to do this, the algorithm requires a minimum replication (HA factor) of 2. This mode assumes all replicas do not fail (kernel panic or power loss) simultaneously in a 50 ms window.

### The sequential profile

This profile optimizes the read-ahead algorithm for sequential workloads, such as backup operations. 

### The random profile

This profile records the IO pattern of recent access and optimizes the read-ahead and data layout algorithms for workloads involving short-term random patterns.

## Configure profiles

You can configure IO profiles through Kubernetes specs or at the Portworx level, depending on your needs and what operator you're running with.
