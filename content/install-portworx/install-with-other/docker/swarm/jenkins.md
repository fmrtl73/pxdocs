Portworx can easily be used to simplify the deployment of Jenkins running as a container, as shown by the example below

## Create a Portworx volume
The example below create a 5GB "jenkins_vol1" volume, replicated on 3 different nodes.

```text
docker volume create -d pxd --name jenkins_vol1 --opt size=5 --opt repl=3
```

## Launch Jenkins through Docker
Using the name of the volume previously created, start up Jenkins as a container.

```text
docker run -d -p 49001:8080 -v jenkins_vol1:/var/jenkins_home:z -t jenkins
```

## Provide the Secret Password
Bring up a browser to the host where you launched Jenkins on port 49001.
You should see

![jenkins1](/img/jenkins1.png)

Run "docker ps" to find the CONTAINER ID of the Jenkins container:

```text
docker ps
```

```output
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                NAMES
9dfa72c4328c        jenkins                  "/bin/tini -- /usr/lo"   29 seconds ago      Up 23 seconds       50000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49001->8080/tcp   ecstatic_ptolemy
```

Run the following command to extract the secret password (substituting the actual CONTAINER ID):

```text
docker exec -it 9dfa72c4328c cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
