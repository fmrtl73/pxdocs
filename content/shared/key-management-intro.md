## Portworx Encrypted Volumes

Portworx has two different kinds of encrypted volumes:

- **Encrypted Volumes**

    Encrypted volumes are regular volumes which can be accessed from only one node.

- **Encrypted Sharedv4 Volumes**

    Encrypted sharedv4 volume allows access to the same encrypted volume from multiple nodes.
