| sharedv4              | Creates a globally shared namespace volume which can be used by multiple pods over NFS with POSIX compliant semantics                                                                                                                                                                                     | sharedv4: "true"          |
| sharedv4_svc_type | Indicates the mechanism Kubernetes will use for locating your `sharedv4` volume. If you use this flag and there's a failover of the nodes running your `sharedv4` volume, you no longer need to restart your pods. Possible values are: ClusterIP or LoadBalancer. | sharedv4_svc_type: "ClusterIP" |
| sharedv4_failover_strategy        | Specifies how aggressively to fail over to a new server for a Sharedv4 or Sharedv4 Service volume (Valid Values: aggressive, normal)  | sharedv4_failover_strategy: "aggressive"
| priority_io           | Specifies IO Priority: low\|medium\|high. The default is low | priority_io: "high" |
| io_profile        | Overrides I/O algorithm that Portworx uses for a volume. For more information about IO profiles, see the [IO profiles](/concepts/io-profiles) section of the documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | io_profile: "db"      |

| fg                    | Enforces volume group policy. If a volume belonging to a group cannot find nodes for its replication sets which don't have other volumes of the same group, the volume creation will fail.                                                                        | fg: "true"                |
