With _Portworx_, secrets are neither stored locally nor displayed. Instead, the credentials are stored as part of the secret endpoint given to _Portworx_ for persisting authentication across reboots. You can manage your secrets through the `pxctl secrets` command. To see the list of available sub-commands and flags, run:


```text
pxctl secrets --help
