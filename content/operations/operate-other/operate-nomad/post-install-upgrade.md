Upgrade Portworx with Nomad by editing the `portworx.nomad` file you used for initial deployment and updating the container version.

Perform the following steps to update to the latest Portworx version:

1. Modify the `image` key value in your `portworx.nomad` file, changing the version to the latest Portworx version, for example, `2.11.1`:

```text
image = "portworx/oci-monitor:2.11.1"
```

2. Rerun the `portworx.nomad` file:

```text
nomad run portworx.nomad
```

Nomad will do a rolling upgrade, i.e., only one instance will be updated at a time, not causing an impact on any applications (assuming application are running with more than one volume replica).

During the upgrade, you may see two versions of Portworx since we are doing a rolling upgrade:
