This guide provides steps for mounting a disk in the `ReadOnlyMany`(ROM) access mode. The in-tree Portworx driver for Kubernetes does not support creating PVCs with the `ReadOnlyMany(ROM)` access mode. To achieve this functionality, follow the steps below:

1. Create a `sharedv4` volume. Note that you can access a `sharedv4` volume from multiple pods at the same time. For details about creating a `sharedv4` volume, refer to the [Create sharedv4 PVCs](/operations/operate-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-pvcs/create-sharedv4-pvcs/) page. 

2. Add a `persistentVolumeClaim` subsection to the `volumes` section of your Pod, specifying the following fields and values: 

    * **readOnly:** with the `true` value
    * **claimName:** with the name of the PVC you created in the step above

        ```text
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: pvpod
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: test-container
            image: gcr.io/google_containers/test-webserver
            volumeMounts:
            - name: test-vol
              mountPath: /test-portworx-volume
          volumes:
          - name: test-vol
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: pvcsc001
              readOnly: true
        ```
