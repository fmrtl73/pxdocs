Pairing with a GKE cluster requires the following additional steps because you also need to
pass in your Google Cloud credentials which will be used to generate access
tokens.

## Create a service account
Use [the guide from Google Cloud to generate a service-account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys)
and save it as gcs-key.json. You can also create this using the following command:

```text
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create gcs-key.json --iam-account <your_iam_account>
```

## Create a Secret from the service-account key
On the source cluster, create a secret in kube-system namespace with
the service account json created in the previous step:

```text
kubectl create secret  generic --from-file=gcs-key.json -n kube-system gke-creds
```

```output
secret/gke-creds created
```

## Pass the Secret to Stork

### When Stork is deployed through the Operator

The credentials created in the previous step need to be provided to Stork. When deployed through Portworx Operator, add the following to the `stork` section of the StorageCluster spec:

```text
  stork:
    enabled: true    
    volumes:
    - name: gke-creds
      mountPath: /root/.gke/gcs-key.json
      readOnly: true
      secret:
        secretName: gke-creds
    env:
    - name: CLOUDSDK_AUTH_CREDENTIAL_FILE_OVERRIDE
      value: /root/.gke/gcs-key.json
```

### When Stork is deployed using the Portworx DaemonSet model

Mount the secret created above in the Stork deployment by performing the following steps.

1. Run the following command to make updates:

    ```text
    kubectl edit deployment -n kube-system stork
    ```

1. Add the following under `spec.template.spec`:

    ```text
    volumes:
    - name: gke-creds
      secret:
        secretName: gke-creds
    ```

1. Add the following under `spec.template.spec.containers`:

    ```text
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /root/.gke/
      name: gke-creds
      readOnly: true
    ```

1. Add the following under `spec.template.spec.containers`:

    ```text
    env:
    - name: CLOUDSDK_AUTH_CREDENTIAL_FILE_OVERRIDE
      value: /root/.gke/gcs-key.json
    ```

1. Save the changes and wait for all the Stork pods to be in running state after applying the changes:

    ```text
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l name=stork
    ```

## Update ClusterRoleBinding

Create a `clusterrolebinding` to give your account the cluster-admin role:

```text
kubectl create clusterrolebinding stork-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<your_iam_account>
```
