This page will guide you on how to give your etcd certificates to Portworx using Kubernetes Secrets. This is the recommended way of providing etcd certificates, as the certificates will be automatically available to the new nodes joining the cluster.

#### Create Kubernetes secret

Copy all your etcd certificates and key in a directory `etcd-secrets/` to create a Kubernetes secret from it.

```text
ls -1 etcd-secrets/
```

```output
etcd-ca.crt
etcd.crt
etcd.key
```

Use `kubectl` to create the secret named `px-kvdb-auth` from the above files:

```text
kubectl -n kube-system create secret generic px-kvdb-auth --from-file=etcd-secrets/
```

Notice that the secret has 3 keys `etcd-ca.crt`, `etcd.crt` and `etcd.key`, corresponding to file names in the `etcd-secrets` folder. We will use these keys in the Portworx spec file to reference the certificates.

```text
kubectl -n kube-system describe secret px-kvdb-auth
```

```output
Name:         px-kvdb-auth
Namespace:    kube-system
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
etcd-ca.crt:      1679 bytes
etcd.crt:  1680 bytes
etcd.key:  414  bytes
```

#### Edit the Portworx spec file

Once the secret is created we need to edit the Portworx spec file to consume the certificates from the secret.

To mount the certificates under `/etc/pwx/etcdcerts` inside the Portworx container, add the following under the _volumeMounts_ in the Portworx DaemonSet.

```text
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /etc/pwx/etcdcerts
    name: etcdcerts
```

Now, we use the keys from the secret that we created and mount it under paths that Portworx will use to talk to the etcd server. In the `items` below, the `key` is the key from the `px-kvdb-auth` secret and the `path` is the relative path from `/etc/pwx/etcdcerts` where Kubernetes will mount the certificates. Put the following under the _volumes_ section of the Portworx DaemonSet.

```text
  volumes:
  - name: etcdcerts
    secret:
      secretName: px-kvdb-auth
      items:
      - key: etcd-ca.crt
        path: etcd-ca.crt
      - key: etcd.crt
        path: etcd.crt
      - key: etcd.key
        path: etcd.key
```

Now that the certificates are mounted at `/etc/pwx/etcdcerts` and the sub-paths that we specified in the _volumes_ section, change the Portworx container args to use the correct certificate paths:

```text
  containers:
  - name: portworx
    args:
      ["-c", "test-cluster", "-a", "-f",
      "-ca", "/etc/pwx/etcdcerts/etcd-etcd-ca.crt",
      "-cert", "/etc/pwx/etcdcerts/etcd.crt",
      "-key", "/etc/pwx/etcdcerts/etcd.key",
      "-x", "kubernetes"]
```
