PX-Central simplifies management, monitoring, and metadata services for one or more Portworx clusters on Kubernetes. Using this single pane of glass, enterprises can easily manage the state of their hybrid- and multi-cloud Kubernetes applications with embedded monitoring and metrics directly in the Portworx user interface.

A Portworx cluster needs to be updated to {{< pxEnterprise >}} 2.9 before using PX-Central. 

For more information about installing PX-Central and its components, refer to the [PX-Central documentation](https://central.docs.portworx.com/).
