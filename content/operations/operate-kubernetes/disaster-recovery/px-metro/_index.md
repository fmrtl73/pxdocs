Portworx supports synchronous DR when installed as a single stretch cluster across multiple Kubernetes clusters. The Kubernetes clusters need to span across a metropolitan area network with a maximum latency of 10ms.
This document explains how to install such a stretch Portworx cluster and achieve synchronous DR. It will demonstrate how to failover and failback applications between two Kubernetes clusters.
Here are the steps you should follow:
