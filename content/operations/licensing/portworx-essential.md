{{< pxEssentials >}} is a free Portworx license with limited functionality that allows you to run small production or proof-of-concept workloads. Essentials limits capacity and advanced features, but otherwise functions the same way as the fully-featured {{< pxEnterprise >}} version of Portworx.

The {{< pxEssentials >}} license requires that your clusters be connected to the internet and send usage data to PX-Central. {{< pxEssentials >}} clusters connect with PX-Central once per hour to renew license leases. Lease periods last for 24 hours, ensuring that any temporary interruptions to your connectivity do not impact your cluster.

To get started with {{< pxEssentials >}}, sign up and generate a spec on [PX-Central](https://central.portworx.com/). Licenses for Essentials are generated automatically and activate when your cluster connects to PX-Central.
