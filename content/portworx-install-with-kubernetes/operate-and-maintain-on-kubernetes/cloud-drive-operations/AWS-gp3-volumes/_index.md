## Add a gp3 drive

To add a gp3 drive, enter the `pxctl service drive add` command with the `-s` option, specifying the following:

* `type=gp3`
* `size=` with a size value <!-- in GiB? -->
* `iops=` with your desired iops value

```text
pxctl service drive add -s "type=gp3,size=200,iops=3500"
```
```output
Adding drives may make storage offline for the duration of the operation.
Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
```
<!-- Don't have full output -->

## Upgrade a gp2 drive to a gp3 drive

Perform the following steps to upgrade your existing AWS cloud drives from gp2 to gp3:

1. Find the EBS volume ID of the volume you want to convert by running the following `pxctl clouddrive inspect` command, specifying the `--node-id` of the node where your volume is attached: 
   
    ```text
    pxctl clouddrive inspect --node <px-node-id>
    ```
    ```output
    Drive Set Configuration
	Number of drives in the Drive Set:  2
	NodeID:  ee906a47-f61d-4acc-ac65-987d406fbc14
	NodeIndex:  0
	InstanceID:  i-0ea9e24fe13f6e1b9
	Zone:  us-east-1b
	State:  In Use
	Labels:  map[]

	Drive  0
		ID:  vol-0e67322e9bcccfacd
		Type:  gp2
		Size:  150 Gi
		Iops:  450
		Path:  /dev/nvme2n1
		Used for:  kvdb

	Drive  1
		ID:  vol-0b181a78f74d37ea5
		Type:  gp2
		Size:  500 Gi
		Iops:  1500
		Path:  /dev/nvme1n1
		Used for:  data
    ```

2. Using the AWS CLI or AWS console, convert the volume type:

    ```text
    aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-type gp3 --volume-id vol-0c0accbf72047052e
    {
        "VolumeModification": {
            "VolumeId": "vol-0c0accbf72047052e",
            "ModificationState": "modifying",
            "TargetSize": 150,
            "TargetIops": 3000,
            "TargetVolumeType": "gp3",
            "OriginalSize": 150,
            "OriginalIops": 450,
            "OriginalVolumeType": "gp2",
            "Progress": 0,
            "StartTime": "2021-06-29T10:52:43+00:00"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Once you've successfully converted the volume type, make the Portworx node aware of the volume type change by cycling it through maintenance mode:

    ```text
    pxctl service maintenance --enter
    ```
    ```output
    This is a disruptive operation, PX will restart in maintenance mode.
    Are you sure you want to proceed ? (Y/N): y
    Entering Maintenance mode...
    ```

    ```text
    pxctl service maintenance --exit
    ```
    ```output
    Exiting Maintenance mode...
    ```

    Repeat this process on all nodes where converted EBS volumes are attached.


4. Verify volume type in output of `pxctl cd inspect --node <px node-id>` command. 
   
    ```text
    pxctl clouddrive inspect --node ee906a47-f61d-4acc-ac65-987d406fbc14
    ```
    ```output
    Drive Set Configuration
	Number of drives in the Drive Set:  2
	NodeID:  ee906a47-f61d-4acc-ac65-987d406fbc14
	NodeIndex:  0
	InstanceID:  i-0ea9e24fe13f6e1b9
	Zone:  us-east-1b
	State:  In Use
	Labels:  map[]

	Drive  0
		ID:  vol-0e67322e9bcccfacd
		Type:  gp3
		Size:  150 Gi
		Iops:  450
		Path:  /dev/nvme2n1
		Used for:  kvdb

	Drive  1
		ID:  vol-0b181a78f74d37ea5
		Type:  gp3
		Size:  500 Gi
		Iops:  1500
		Path:  /dev/nvme1n1
		Used for:  data
    ```

    Repeat this process on all nodes where converted EBS volumes are attached.
