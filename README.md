# Portworx Documentation

[![Travis branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/portworx/pxdocs/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/portworx/pxdocs)

A [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) implementation of the Portworx documentation.

## Development

To develop the docs site locally - first ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed and then:

```bash
make develop
```

You can then view the site in your browser at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).  As you edit content in the `content` folder - the browser will refresh as you save files.

## versions

Each version of the docs is kept on a different branch.  For example do `git checkout 1.3` before running `make develop` to edit the `1.3` version of the docs.

To activate the version dropdown that appears in production - the following variables need to be exported before you run `make develop`:

```bash
export VERSIONS_ALL="1.3,1.4"
export VERSIONS_CURRENT="1.3"
export VERSIONS_BASE_URL="docs.portworx.wk1.co"
```

**note** if you use the version dropdown - it will redirect to the live site.  If you want to edit a different version locally - use `git checkout <VERSION>`

## updating the theme

It's important to make sure the theme the docs site uses is up to date.  To do this:

```bash
make update-theme
```

This will pull in the latest content from [pxdocs-tooling](https://github.com/portworx/pxdocs-tooling) - make sure you `git commit` once you have updated the theme.

Make sure you update the theme for each of the version branches if the theme changes.

If you want to make changes to the templates or CSS - these files live in the `layouts` and `static` folder of the [pxdocs-tooling](https://github.com/portworx/pxdocs-tooling) repo.  Make the changes there and then re-update each of the version branches.

## publish site

If you want to generate the built website locally - you can:

```bash
make publish
```

This will generate a `public` folder in which the static docs website for the current version branch is placed.

## algolia search

If you want the algolia search bar to be activated locally for testing - you will need to export the following variables - get these from an administrator:

```bash
export ALGOLIA_APP_ID=XXX
export ALGOLIA_API_KEY=XXX
export ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY=XXX
export ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=local-docs
```

Then you will need to update the remote algolia index with the contents of the site:

```bash
make search-index
```

Finally run `make develop` as normal and the algolia search bar should display with the content of the site indexed.

You can always re-run the `make search` command again to re-index.

## deployment

Deployment of your changes is handled by Travis upon a git push to the git repo.  Once you have made changes and viewed them locally - a `git push` of the version branch you are working on will result in the content being deployed into production.

## editing content

Each page is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and uses [front-matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) in YAML format to describe the page.

The important fields in the front-matter are as follow:

 * `title` - the name of the page and the name that will appear on the menu
 * `weight` - what order the page will appear in the menu and previous & next links within sections

#### sections

The menu on the left hand side is build from the `section` pages.  A section is created by making `_index.md` file within a folder.

You can make sections within sections by placing folders with `_index.md` files recursively in a folder tree - the menu will render the sections into the same tree represented by the folders.

#### reusing content

To re-use the same content across multiple pages - we use the `content` shortcode.  Here is an example from the kubernetes installation section where there are multiple sections re-using the same page content:

```
---
title: 2. Secure ETCD and Certificates
weight: 2
---

{{% content "portworx-install-with-kubernetes/shared/2-secure-etcd-and-certificates.md" %}}
```

This page will live inside it's section but render the content from the `portworx-install-with-kubernetes/shared/2-secure-etcd-and-certificates.md` file.

To create a section that has shared content but is not rendered in the tree (like the `shared` folder in the example above) - we use the `hidden` value of the front-matter.  Here is the `_index.md` for the shared section that provides the content files used above:


```
---
title: Shared
hidden: true
---

Shared content for kubernetes installation
```

This means we can add files into the `shared` folder but they won't show up in the menu.

#### Linking between sections

Pages within a section will display **next** and **previous** links based on the `weight` property of the front-matter.  Sometimes it's useful to put a manual link into a page (or shared content) to keep the flow going.

Use the `widelink` shortcode to do this as follows:

```
{{< widelink url="/application-install-with-kubernetes" >}}Stateful applications on Kubernetes{{</widelink>}}
```

This will render the wide orange links to the page url given.

#### Section homepages

The `_index.md` page of a section can contain content and it will list all of the pages and/or sections that live below it.

You can disable the list of child links using the `hidesections` property of the front-matter in the `_index.md` page - then it will only render the section page content.

#### Redirects

To control redirecting from old page URLs to new pages - you must put a `redirect_from` parameter into the front-matter of the new page.

An example to redirect two stale URLs to a page:

```yaml
---
title: 1. Prepare your platform
weight: 1
redirect_from:
  - /cloud/azure/k8s_tectonic.html
  - /apples/pears.html
---
```

## hugo docs

Because the site is based on hugo - you can use any of the shortcodes, functions and variables listed in the [hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
